## Setup

```{r}
library(MASS)
library(ISLR2)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
```

## Replication from Section of edx course

### Simple linear regression

```{r simple-linear}
names(Boston)
?Boston

plot(medv ~ lstat, Boston) #medv + median value of owner occupied homes, lstat = lower status of the population (percent)

fit1 <- lm(medv ~ lstat, Boston)
summary(fit1)

abline(fit1, col = "red") #only works with output in console

confint(fit1)

new_data <- data.frame(lstat = c(5, 10, 15))
predict(fit1, newdata = new_data, interval = "confidence")
```

### Mutiple linear regression

```{r mulitple-linear}
fit2 <- lm(medv ~ lstat + age, data = Boston)
summary(fit2)

fit3 <- lm(medv ~ ., data = Boston)
summary(fit3)
plot(fit3)

fit4 <- update(fit3, ~.-age-indus) #remove age and indus, everything else from model 3
summary(fit4)
```

### With interaction

```{r}
fit5 <- lm(medv ~ lstat * age, data = Boston) #main effects + interaction
summary(fit5)
```

### Quadratic function

```{r}
fit6 <- lm(medv ~ lstat + I(lstat^2), data = Boston) #I for identity function
summary(fit6)

attach(Boston) #make names from Boston available in data space

plot(medv ~ lstat)
points(lstat, fitted(fit6), col = "red", pch = 20)

#add 4th degree polynomial

fit7 <- lm(medv ~ poly(lstat, 4), data = Boston)
points(lstat, fitted(fit7), col = "blue", pch = 20)

plot(1:20, 1:20, pch = 1:20)
```

### Qualitative Predictors

```{r}
summary(Carseats)

```

## Exercises

### Conceptual

#### Exercise 1

> Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in Table 3.4 correspond. Explain what conclusions you can draw based on these p-values. Your explanation should be phrased in terms of sales, TV, radio, and newspaper, rather than in terms of the coefficients of the linear model.

![](images/clipboard-3507043570.png)

$H_0$ TV : TV advertising has no effect of units sold when radio and newspaper advertising are held constant

$H_0$ radio: radio advertising has no effect of units sold when TV and newspaper advertising are held constant

$H_0$ newspaper: newspaper advertising has no effect of units sold when TV and radio advertising are held constant

Based on the p-values and a conventional alpha of 0.05 we reject the first two null hypotheses. (Is multiplicity and issue here?).

We can also conclude that without any speding there are still some \~3 units solid.

#### Exercise 2

> Carefully explain the differences between the KNN classifier and KNN regression methods.

The KNN classifier examines the class (qualitative) of the $K$ nearest points in the space). $x_0$ is assigned the most frequent class among $K$. KNN regression just averages the value of the $K$ points for $x_0$.

#### Exercise 3

> Suppose we have a data set with five predictors, $X_1$ = GPA, $X_2$ = IQ, $X_3$ = Level (1 for College and 0 for High School), $X_4$ = Interaction between GPA and IQ, and $X_5$ = Interaction between GPA and Level. The response is starting salary after graduation (in thousands of dollars). Suppose we use least squares to fit the model, and get $\hat\beta_0 = 50$, $\hat\beta_1 = 20$, $\hat\beta_2 = 0.07$, $\hat\beta_3 = 35$, $\hat\beta_4 =
> 0.01$, $\hat\beta_5 = -10$.
>
> a.  Which answer is correct, and why?
>     i.  For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, high school graduates earn more on average than college graduates.
>     ii. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, college graduates earn more on average than high school graduates.
>     iii. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, high school graduates earn more on average than college graduates provided that the GPA is high enough.
>     iv. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, college graduates earn more on average than high school graduates provided that the GPA is high enough.

The model is :

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{GPA} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{IQ} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Level} + \beta_4 \cdot \text{GPA} \cdot \text{IQ} + \beta_5 \cdot \text{GPA} \cdot \text{Level}
$$

$$
\text{salary} \sim 50 + 20*GPA + 0.07 * IQ + 35 * College + 0.01 * GPA:IQ + (-10)* GPA:College
$$

If we fix IQ and GPA and change from high school to college :

$$
\Delta y = 35 * 1 - 10 * GPA
$$

$\Delta y > 0 \Rightarrow \beta_3 + \beta_5 \cdot \text{GPA} > 0 \Rightarrow \text{GPA} < \dfrac{-\beta_3}{\beta_5} = \dfrac{-35}{-10} = 3.5$

i\) I'm actually unsure. The intercept is 35y higher for college students. But the slope depends on the GPA. If someone went to college with a high GPA, they might end up with a lower salary than if they had not gone to college ?

ii\) again, I'm unsure

iii\) if they didn't go to college, the interaction for high school students will be zero. But for the same college students is will exist and with high GPA will result in a lower slope â€“\> right answer

```{r}
model <- function(gpa, iq, level){
  y <- 50 + 
    20 * gpa + 
    0.07 * iq + 
    35 * level + 
    gpa * iq * 0.01 + 
    gpa * level * -10
  
  return(y)
}

x <- seq(1, 5, length = 10) #gpa
y <- seq(1, 200, length = 20) #iq
college <- t(outer(x, y, model, level = 1))
high_school <- t(outer(x, y, model, level = 0))

#use plotly because ggplot doesn't two three axes
plot_ly(x = x, y = y) |>
  add_surface(
    z = ~college,
    colorscale = list(c(0, 1), c("rgb(107,184,214)", "rgb(0,90,124)")),
    colorbar = list(title = "College")) |>
  add_surface(
    z = ~high_school,
    colorscale = list(c(0, 1), c("rgb(255,112,184)", "rgb(128,0,64)")),
    colorbar = list(title = "High school")) |>
  layout(scene = list(
    xaxis = list(title = "GPA"),
    yaxis = list(title = "IQ"),
    zaxis = list(title = "Salary")))
```

> b.  Predict the salary of a college graduate with IQ of 110 and a GPA of 4.0

```{r}
model(gpa = 4, iq = 110, level = 1)
```

> c.  True or false: Since the coefficient for the GPA/IQ interaction term is very small, there is very little evidence of an interaction effect. Justify your answer

False. A small effect might still have a lot of statistical evidence for it. It depends on the power we have.

#### Question 4

> I collect a set of data ($n = 100$ observations) containing a single predictor and a quantitative response. I then fit a linear regression model to the data, as well as a separate cubic regression, i.e. $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X +
> \beta_2X^2 + \beta_3X^3 + \epsilon$.
>
> a.  Suppose that the true relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is linear, i.e. $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon$. Consider the training residual sum of squares (RSS) for the linear regression, and also the training RSS for the cubic regression. Would we expect one to be lower than the other, would we expect them to be the same, or is there not enough information to tell? Justify your answer.

We the training RSS for the cubic regression to be because it will fit to random non-linear variation in the data, driving down RSS.

> b.  Answer (a) using test rather than training RSS.

This depends on the distribution of the response variable. If it's truly linear test RSS for cubic regression will be higher.

> c.  Suppose that the true relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is not linear, but we don't know how far it is from linear. Consider the training RSS for the linear regression, and also the training RSS for the cubic regression. Would we expect one to be lower than the other, would we expect them to be the same, or is there not enough information to tell? Justify your answer.

We would expect training RSS to be lower for cubic regression.

> d.  Answer (c) using test rather than training RSS.

There is not enough information to tell, it depends on how non-linear the true relationship is.

#### Exercise 5

> Consider the fitted values that result from performing linear regression without an intercept. In this setting, the ith fitted value takes the form $$\hat{y}_i = x_i\hat\beta,$$ where $$\hat{\beta} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i\right) / \left(\sum_{i' = 1}^n x^2_{i'}\right).$$ show that we can write $$\hat{y}_i = \sum_{i' = 1}^na_{i'}y_{i'}$$ What is $a_{i'}$?
>
> *Note: We interpret this result by saying that the fitted values from linear regression are linear combinations of the response values.*
